 * interaction_data is a module responsible for collecting and

 * interaction with the dialog.  It aggregates information that is not
 * user specific like the user's OS, Browser, and the interface
 * elements they've clicked on.  It stores this information in
 * localstorage, and at initialization reports previous interaction
 * data to the server.  This data is then used to optimize the user
 * experience of the Persona dialog.
