  note: the mysql methods have a bunch of boilerplate, i'd love

      function(err, rows) {

  a simpler API could just pass in a query, params, and a filter function:

  query('SQL STRING HERE', params, function(rows) {
    return rows && resp.length === 1 ? rows[0].baz : undefined
  });

  where you assume that errbacks are handled by the query() func.
