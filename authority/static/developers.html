      <p>
        With BrowserID you can implement <b>simple</b> and <b>sophisticated</b> authentication on your site
        that your <b>users will love</b>.  All this with just a few lines of code!  Let's get started:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <div class="number">1.</div>
      <p><b>Enable BrowserID:</b> First you must include the BrowserID JavaScript library in your site.  Just add a script tag to your <tt>&lt;head&gt;</tt></p>

      <pre><code>&lt;script src="https://browserid.org/include.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <div class="number">2.</div>
      <p>
        <b>Identify the User:</b>
      Now you'll need to hook up your <i>login</i> and <i>sign-in</i> buttons to BrowserID.  Instead of displaying
      a form which asks for a <i>username</i> and <i>password</i>, with BrowserID you make a javascript call and
      the interaction with the user is handled for you.
      </p>
<pre><code class="javascript">navigator.id.getVerifiedEmail(function(assertion) {
    if (assertion) {
        // This code will be invoked once the user has successfully
        // selected an email address they control to log in with.
    } else {
        // something went wrong!  the user isn't logged in.
    }
});
</code></pre>
<p>
Again, the above code should run when a user clicks the
<i>login</i> button on your site.  Upon a successful login, you'll be
called back with an <i>assertion</i>, which contains the user's email
address, along with crytographic proof that the user is who they
say they are (proof which comes from the email provider).
</p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <div class="number">3.</div>
      <p>
        <b>Verify the User's Identify:</b> Next we should check that
        the user really is who they <i>say</i> they are.  The process of
        doing this is basically checking that the assertion is
        properly signed by their email provider.  Once this is done we can
        be sure that the email provider agress that the user is actual.
      </p>
      <p>
        The easiest way to verify is to use the
        free <i>verfication</i> service provided by BrowserID.  To use
        it, you send a request
        to <tt>https://browserid.org/verify</tt> with the assertion as
        a GET parameter.  You <b>should</b> perform this request from
        your server, but for illustrative purposes, here's how it
        might look from the client:

        <pre><code>var url = "https://browserid.org/verify?assertion="
        + window.encodeURIComponent(assertion)
        + "&audience=" + window.encodeURIComponent(window.location.host);

$.get(url, function(result) {
    if (result.status === "okay") alert("verification is valid!");
    else alert("uh oh, bogus verification!");
});</pre></code>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <div class="number">4.</div>
      <p><b>Complete the log in!</b>  Having completed the steps above, you can trust that the user is really identified
        by the email stored in the assertion under the <tt>assertion.email</tt> property.  You don't need to perform
        any additional authentication unless you want to!  From here, you can set up session cookies and do whatever you
        like.
      </p>
